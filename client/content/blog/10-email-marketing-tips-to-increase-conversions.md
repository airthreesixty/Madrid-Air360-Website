Is email marketing still relevant in 2022? We’ll answer that with a resounding yes.

Impressively, email marketing is still 40 times more effective at reaching your target audience than social media marketing efforts. Perhaps even more incredibly, the number of emails sent and received annually has increased every year since 2017, with 333.2 billion emails sent every day in 2022. 

As online shopping continues to increase in popularity, email will play an even more important role in attracting and converting customers. Yet not all email marketing metrics are created equal.

In the modern era, email conversions are one of the most essential metrics for marketers to focus on. After all, the effort you’re putting into email marketing will go to waste if customers aren’t actually doing what you want them to do.

How can DTC eCommerce brands boost conversions? In this post, we’ll highlight the best ways to increase conversion rates in any email marketing campaigns.

## 1. Segment Your Audiences
No matter how great your email content is, if you’re sending it to the wrong audience, it will fall flat. This is why audience segmentation is such a critical part of effective email marketing. Segment your email list based on website user behavior, demographics and purchase history in order to better serve your customers — and quickly boost conversions. In fact, marketers who segment their email campaigns can see a revenue increase of up to 760%.
